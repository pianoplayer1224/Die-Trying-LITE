# calculator loads here and vice versa. Ten base64 characters, six bits
# each, packed as a bit stream:
#   levels 11 | progress 9 | money 16 | rolls 13 | wipes 11 = 60 bits
# Spending is the sum of the costs of the levels owned and earnings are
# money + spending, so neither is stored. There is no room for a
# checksum; loads are sanity-checked instead (levels in range, wipes no
# greater than rolls, no money before the first roll).
#
# Unlike the calculator, this version can write files, so it also
# auto-saves to SAVE_FILE and resumes from it without any typing. The
# file keeps playtime and best run too, which do not fit in the code.
